This repo shows how you can do the following:

* Create a GRPC service using ASP.NET Core
* Run it in Google Cloud Run
* Create a frontend ASP.NET Core web app and run it in Google Cloud Run as well
* Authenticate using s service account when calling the GRPC service from the frontend.

This example uses Pulumi to create the infrastructure.
